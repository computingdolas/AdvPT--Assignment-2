# Elliptic-Solver-1-D-using-Stencil

This is the code to solve one dimensional poisson equation with Jacobi iterations . There are two approaches to the same problem , basically one 
tries to solve poisson equation bu simple matrix inversion and in other approach one tries to solve by using stencil approach .
